HE EVIDENCE LINKING PROTO-ONCOGENES TO THE INDUC- 
tion or maintenance of human malignancies is largely cir- 
cumstantial, but has become increasingly compelling. This 
circumstantial evidence is derived from studies of animal models, 
tumor cell lines, and actual human tumors. Data from animal models 
and cell lines include: (i) sequence homology between human proto- 
oncogenes and the viral oncogenes of transforming retroviruses that 
are known to be tumorigenic in some species (1, 2); (i) transfection 
studies showing the transforming potential of proto-oncogenes in
are known to be tumorigenic in some species (1, 2); (i) transfection 
studies showing the transforming potential of proto-oncogenes in 
NIH 3T3 cells and primary embryo fibroblasts (3-5); and (iii) the 
central role of certain proto-oncogenes in tumorigenesis by chronic 
transforming retroviruses such as avian leukosis virus (6). Data from 
human tumors include: (i) increased expression of specific proto- 
oncogenes in some human malignancies (7, 8); (i) localization of 
proto-oncogenes at or near the site of specific, tumor-associated 
chromosomal translocations (9); and (iii) amplification of proto- 
oncogenes in some human tumors (10, 11). 
Additional data linking proto-oncogenes to cell growth is their 
expression in response to certain proliferation signals (12, 13) and 
their expression during embryonic development (14, 15). More 
direct evidence comes from the fact that, of the 20 known proto- 
oncogenes, three are related to a growth factor or a growth factor
their expression during embryonic development (14, 15). More 
direct evidence comes from the fact that, of the 20 known proto- 
oncogenes, three are related to a growth factor or a growth factor 
receptor. These genes include c-sis, which is homologous to the 
9 JANUARY 1987 transforming gene of the simian sarcoma virus and is the B chain of 
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (16, 17); c-fims, which is 
homologous to the transforming gene of the feline sarcoma virus 
and is closely related to the macrophage colony-stimulating factor 
receptor (CSE-1R) (18); and c-erbB, which encodes the EGF 
receptor (EGFR) and is highly homologous to the transforming 
gene of the avian erythroblastosis virus (19). The two receptor- 
related proto-oncogenes, c-fims and c-erbB, are members of the 
tyrosine-specific protein kinase family to which many proto-onco- 
genes belong. 
Recently, a novel transforming gene was identified as a result of
tyrosine-specific protein kinase family to which many proto-onco- 
genes belong. 
Recently, a novel transforming gene was identified as a result of 
transfection studies with DNA from chemically induced rat neu- 
roglioblastomas (20). This gene, called #ex, was shown to be related 
to, but distinct from, the c-er4B proto-oncogene (21). By means of 
v-erbB and human EGFR as probes to screen human genomic and 
complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries, two other groups indepen- 
dently isolated human erbB—related genes that they called HER-2 
(22) and c-erbB-2 (23). Subsequent sequence analysis and chromo- 
somal mapping studics revealed all three genes (#ex, c-erbB-2, and 
HER-2) to be the same (22, 24, 25). A fourth group, also using v- 
erbB as a probe, identified the same gene in 2 mammary carcinoma 
cell line, MAC 117, where it was found to be amplified five- to ten- 
fold (26). 
This gene, which we will call HER-2/nex, encodes a new member
cell line, MAC 117, where it was found to be amplified five- to ten- 
fold (26). 
This gene, which we will call HER-2/nex, encodes a new member 
of the tyrosine kinase family; and is closely related to, but distinct 
from, the EGFR gene (22). HER-2/neu differs from EGFR in that it 
is found on band q21 of chromosome 17 (22, 24, 25), as compared 
to band pl1-pl3 of chromosome 7, where the EGFR gene is 
located (27). Also, the HER-2/new gene generates a messenger 
RNA (mRNA) of 4.8 kb (22), which differs from the 5.8- and 10- 
kb transcripts for the EGFR gene (28). Finally, the protein encoded 
by the HER-2/neu gene is 185,000 daltons (21), as compared to the 
170,000-dalton protein encoded by the EGFR gene. Conversely, on 
the basis of sequence data, HER-2/neu is more closely related to the 
EGFR gene than to other members of the tyrosine kinase family 
(22). Like the EGFR protein, HER-2/new has an extracellular 
domain, a transmembrane domain that includes two cysteine-rich
EGFR gene than to other members of the tyrosine kinase family 
(22). Like the EGFR protein, HER-2/new has an extracellular 
domain, a transmembrane domain that includes two cysteine-rich 
repeat clusters, and an intracellular kinase domain (21), indicating

that it too is likely to be a cellular receptor for an as yet unidentified 
ligand. As a result of the published data showing amplification of HER- 
2/new in a human mammary carcinoma cell line, and as part of an 
ongoing survey in our laboratory of proto-oncogene abnormalities 
in human tumors, we evaluated alterations of the HER-2/new gene 
in a large series of human primary breast cancers. Our results show 
that amplification of this gene occurs relatively frequently in breast 
cancer, and that it is associated with disease relapse and overall 
patient survival. 
Factors that are known to be important in the prognosis of breast 
malignancies in individual patients include: size of the primary 
tumor, stage of disease at diagnosis, hormonal receptor status, and 
number of axillary lymph nodes involved with disease (positive 
nodes) (29). The current study, which was conducted in two parts,
tumor, stage of disease at diagnosis, hormonal receptor status, and 
number of axillary lymph nodes involved with disease (positive 
nodes) (29). The current study, which was conducted in two parts, 
involved the evaluation of tissue from 189 separate breast malignan- 
cies that were part of a breast cancer study ongoing at the University 
of Texas, San Antonio. This cohort of tumors was of interest 
because considerable information was available on the majority of 
the specimens including size of the primary tumor, estrogen recep- 
tor status, progesterone receptor status, age of patient, discase stage, 
and status of the axillary lymph nodes. 
In the initial survey, tissue from 103 primary breast cancers was 
evaluated for alterations in the HER-2/mes gene. DNA from 
individual tumors was prepared as described (30), digested with 
Eco RI, and subjected to Southern blot analysis with a *P-labeled 
HER-2/neu-1 probe, which is known to detect a 13-kb hybridizing
individual tumors was prepared as described (30), digested with 
Eco RI, and subjected to Southern blot analysis with a *P-labeled 
HER-2/neu-1 probe, which is known to detect a 13-kb hybridizing 
band in human DNA (22). Examples of tumors from the initial 
survey are shown in Fig. 1. Of the 103 samples examined, 19 (18%) 
showed evidence of HER-2/new gene amplification. The degree of 
amplification in individual cases was determined by dilution analysis 
(Fig. 2A), as well as soft laser densitometry scanning. To determine 
that the amount of DNA loaded in cach lane was equivalent, all 
filters were washed and rehybridized with a *2P-labeled arginase 
gene probe (31). This probe identifies a 15-kb hybridizing band on 
Eco RI-digested human DNA, and was selected as a control 
because it more appropriatcly assesses the relative amount and

amplification and a number of discase parameters was then per- 
formed. 
Of 103 tumors evaluated in the initial survey, there was essentially 
no correlation between gene amplification and estrogen receptor 
status, erone receptor status, size of tumors, or age at 
diagnosis (Table 1). However, when analysis was performed for 
association between HER-2/new amplification and numbser of posi- 
tive lymph nodes, a trend was noted. This analysis showed that 4/34 
(11%) of patients with no involved nodes, 2/20 (10%) with 1 to 3 
involved nodes, and 8/25 (32%) with >3 involved nodes had gene 
amplification (P = 0.11). If these data were examined by comparing 
0 to 3 positive nodes versus >3 positive nodes, the correlation with 
gene amplification became more significant (P < 0.05). Thus, there

gene amplification became more significant (P < 0.05). Thus, there 
‘was a significant increase in incidence of HER-2/nex gene amplifica- 
tion in patients with >3 axillary lymph nodes involved with disease. 
A multivariate regression analysis to correlate HER-2/nex amplifica- 
tion with various disease parameters identified the number of 
positive nodes as the only significant factor, either alone or in 
combination, to correlate with amplification. 
‘This initial study indicated that it might be possible to discrimi- 
nate among node-positive patients on the basis of HER-2/neu gene 
Fig. 3. Actuarial curve for relapse in (A) node- : positive paticnts with no amplification versus A amplification. It is well known that the number of positive nodes is 
the best prognostic factor for disease recurrence and survival in 
patients with breast cancer (29). Given .the correlation between 
number of nodes positive and HER-2/nes amplification, one might
the best prognostic factor for disease recurrence and survival in 
patients with breast cancer (29). Given .the correlation between 
number of nodes positive and HER-2/nes amplification, one might 
predict that amplification of this gene might also have some 
ic value. No long-term follow-up data, however, were 
available on the 103 patients analyzed in the initial study. For this 
reason, a second study was conducted on 100 breast cancer samples 
from patients with positive axillary lymph nodes. All of the informa- 
tion available for the first group of 103 patients was available for 
these patients. In addition, relapse and survival information was 
available, since these cases had a median follow-up of 46 months 
(range 24 to 86 months}. Of these 100 samples, 86 yielded sufficient 
DNA for study. Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was mea- 
sured as in the initial survey, and examples of tumors from this study 
are shown (Fig. 1). Amplification was found in 34/86 (40%) of
DNA for study. Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was mea- 
sured as in the initial survey, and examples of tumors from this study 
are shown (Fig. 1). Amplification was found in 34/86 (40%) of 
these patients. For this larger sample of node-positive paticnts, 
several statistically significant or nearly significant relationships were 
obscrved. In agreement with the preliminary survey, there was an 
association between number of involved lymph nodes and HER-2/ 
new amplification (Table 2). In addition, the presence of gene 
amplification was correlated with estrogen receptor status and size 
of primary tumor (Table 2). Together, these two surveys yielded 
data on 189 patients and the association of HER-2/nex amplifica- 
tion with various discase parameters in the combined group is 
shown in Table 3.

between HER-2/new amplification and nodal status (P = 0.002) 
indicated that information on amplification of this gene may 
correlate with disease behavior; that is, recurrences and survival. To 
test this, univariate survival analyses were performed in which 
amplification was compared to relapse and survival in this patient 
group. A total of 35 patients had a recurrence of the disease, and 29 
had died at the time of the analyses. Median times to relapse and 
death were 62 months and 69 months, respectively. The median 
follow-up time for patients still alive was 47 months, ranging from 
24 to 86 months. A total of 71 of the 86 patients (83%) received 
some form of therapy after mastectomy: adjuvant systemic therapy 
alone, 47%; adjuvant systemic therapy plus local radiation, 19%; 
and local radiation alone, 17%. A strong and highly statistically 
significant correlation was found between the degree of gene
alone, 47%; adjuvant systemic therapy plus local radiation, 19%; 
and local radiation alone, 17%. A strong and highly statistically 
significant correlation was found between the degree of gene 
amplification and both time to disease relapse (P = <0.0001) and 
survival (P = 0.0011) (Table 4). Moreover, when compared in 
univariate analyses to other parameters, amplification of HER-2/new 
was found to be superior to all other prognostic factors, with the 
exception of the number of positive nodes (which it equaled) in 
predicting time to relapse and overall survival in human breast 
cancer (Table 4). The association between HER-2/nex amplification 
and relapse and survival can be illustrated graphically in actuarial 
survival curves (Fig. 3, A to D). While there was a somewhat 
shortened time to relapse and shorter overall survival in patients 
having any amplification of the HER-2/new gene in their tumors 
(Fig. 3, A and B), the greatest differences were found when
shortened time to relapse and shorter overall survival in patients 
having any amplification of the HER-2/new gene in their tumors 
(Fig. 3, A and B), the greatest differences were found when 
comparing patients with >5 copies of the gene to those without 
amplification (single copy) (Fig. 3, C and D). Patients with greater 
than five copies of HER-2/neu had even shorter disease-free survival

compared to patients with no amplification. The phenomenon of 
greater gene copy number correlating with a worse prognosis has 
also been seen in evaluations of N-mye gene amplification in human 
neuroblastomas (32).

Rearrangement of the HER-2/neu gene was rare. Of the total 189 
tumors evaluated, three showed evidence of rearrangement, and in 
two of the three cases, the rearrangement was identical (Fig. 1, cases 
77 to 79). Also, two of the rearranged HER-2/meu loci were 
amplified (Fig. 1, cases 78 and 79). The incidence of HER-2/nex 
rearrangement as determined by Eco RI digestion was too small to 
attempt statistical correlations. 
To determine whether the phenomenon of amplification of HER- 
2/new in breast cancer extended to related growth factor receptors, 
all filters were analyzed with the EGFR probe (Fig. 4). Amplifica- 
tion of the EGFR gene was found in 4/189 (2%) of the cases, and 
rearrangement of the EGFR gene was found in one of those four 
cases. The incidence of EGFR amplification and rearrangement was 
t00 small to attempt statistical correlation. Comparison of HER-2/
rearrangement of the EGFR gene was found in one of those four 
cases. The incidence of EGFR amplification and rearrangement was 
t00 small to attempt statistical correlation. Comparison of HER-2/ 
new amplification (53/189 or 28%) with that of the EGFR gene 
reveals the incidence of the former to be 14 times greater than that 
of the latter, indicating that the phenomenon of gene amplification 
is not a general one for a related tyrosine kinase-specific receptor in 
human breast cancer. Moreover, studies examining alterations of 
two other tyrosine kinasespecific proto-oncogenes, 44l and fes, in 
breast cancer did not show amplification of these genes (33).

tumors have been examined. In a survey of 121 primary breast 
malignancies, amplification of the c-myc gene was found in 38 
(32%) (34). Attempts to correlate c-myc gene amplification with 
stage of disease, hormonal receptor status, histopathologic grade, or
malignancies, amplification of the c-myc gene was found in 38 
(32%) (34). Attempts to correlate c-myc gene amplification with 
stage of disease, hormonal receptor status, histopathologic grade, or 
axillary node metastases showed no association. There was a statisti- 
cally significant association between c-myc amplification and age at 
diagnosis >50 years in a group of 95 of thesc patients (34). Data on 
relapse and survival were not presented in this study; however, there 
was no correlation between c-mye amplification and nodal status to 
indicate an association with disease behavior. 
The exact role of various proto-oncogenes in the pathogenesis of 
human malignancies remains unclear. One line of evidence implicat- 
ing abnormalities of these genes in human disease is association of 
their amplification with tumor progression in specific cancers. The 
N-myc gene is frequently amplified in human neuroblastomas and 
neuroblastoma cell lines (35, 36). Studies on the N-myc proto-
their amplification with tumor progression in specific cancers. The 
N-myc gene is frequently amplified in human neuroblastomas and 
neuroblastoma cell lines (35, 36). Studies on the N-myc proto- 
oncogene were the first to show a direct association between 
abnormalities in a proto-oncogene and clinical behavior of a human 
tumor. N-myc amplification and expression correlate both with stage 
of disease and overall survival in patients with ncuroblastoma (10, 
32, 37). Moreover the greater the N-myc gene copy numbser, the 
worse the patient prognosis for all stages of the discase (32). Taken 
together, these data indicate a role for the N-myc gene in the 
pathogenesis of neuroblastoma (32). 
Neuroblastoma is a relatively rare disease with an incidence of one 
per 125,000 children. Carcinoma of the breast, however, is a 
common malignancy affecting one of every 13 women in the United 
States. There are 119,000 new cases per year, and approximately
per 125,000 children. Carcinoma of the breast, however, is a 
common malignancy affecting one of every 13 women in the United 
States. There are 119,000 new cases per year, and approximately 
40,000 women will dic of the discase in 1986 (38). Current 
treatment decisions for individual patients are frequently based on 
specific prognostic parameters. The major prognostic factors for 
breast cancer include presence’ or absence of tumor in the axillary 
nodes, size of the primary tumor, and presence or absence of 
hormonal receptors (29). The current study indicates that amplifica- 
tion of the HER-2/new gene is a significant predictor of both overall 
survival and time to relapse in node-positive patients with breast 
cancer. Amplification of the gene retains its prognostic significance 
in multivariate analysis, even when adjustments are made for other 
known prognostic factors. Moreover, amplification of HER-2/nex 
has greater prognostic value than most currently used prognostic
in multivariate analysis, even when adjustments are made for other 
known prognostic factors. Moreover, amplification of HER-2/nex 
has greater prognostic value than most currently used prognostic 
fictors, including progesterone and estrogen receptors, and is 
equivalent to and independent of the best known prognosticator— 
number of positive lymph nodes. Finally, the degree of HER-2/new 
amplification appears to have an effect on survival, with greater copy 
number being associated with a worse prognosis (Fig. 3, C and D). 
A similar phenomenon has been observed for N-myc gene amplifica- 
tion in human neuroblastoma (32). 
The potential role of HER-2/new in the pathogenesis of breast 
cancer is unknown. Like N-myc, the correlation of HER-2/neu 
amplification with discase progression indicates it may be an 
important gene in the disease process. The role of other cell 
9 JANUARY 1987 receptors in the biology of breast cancer is well established (29, 39,
important gene in the disease process. The role of other cell 
9 JANUARY 1987 receptors in the biology of breast cancer is well established (29, 39, 
40). It is casy to speculate that a gene encoding a putative growth 
factor receptor, when expressed in inappropriate amounts, may give 
a growth advantage to the cells expressing it. Alternatively, alter- 
ation in the gene product itself may lead to a critical change in the 
receptor protein. A single point mutation in the transmembrane 
domain of the protein encoded by the rat new oncogene appears to 
be all that is necessary for the gene to gain transforming ability (41). 
Whether this or a similar alteration is found in the amplified HER- 
2/nes gene in human breast cancer will require sequence analysis of 
the homologous region in the amplificd human gene. In addition, 
studies evaluating the expression of this gene at the RNA and/or 
protein level will prove important in determining if HER-2/nex
the homologous region in the amplificd human gene. In addition, 
studies evaluating the expression of this gene at the RNA and/or 
protein level will prove important in determining if HER-2/nex 
amplification results in an expected increased gene expression. The 
question of amplification of HER-2/nex in metastatic as compared 
to primary lesions in a given patient is important. The current study 
utilized only primary breast tumors for analyses. It would be of 
interest to determine if HER-2/new copy number is altered as the 
tumor metastasizes. A recent study evaluating N-myc copy number 
in human small cell carcinoma of the lung showed no difference 
between primary and metastatic lesions (11). 
The initial survey from the current study showed that 15% of 
breast cancer patients with stage I disease (node-negative) have 
HER-2/new amplification. Unfortunately, no long-term follow-up 
data were available for these patients. This stage I setting may be an
HER-2/new amplification. Unfortunately, no long-term follow-up 
data were available for these patients. This stage I setting may be an 
additional group in which HER-2/ne# measurements will have an 
impact in predicting biologic behavior of the tumor, and as a result, 
in design of treatment strategy. Finally, if the HER-2/new genc 
product functions as a growth factor receptor that plays a role in the 
pathogenesis of breast cancer, identification of its ligand and 
development of specific antagonists could have important therapeu- 
tic implications.

(FMDV); and (iv) rhinoviruses, of which there are about 100

are highly variable because of differing tissue tropism, differing viral

virus can produce fatal encephalitis, a strain of EMCV can cause

Picornavirions have relative molecular mass of about 8.5 x 10° 
daltons, of which about 30 percent is RNA. The virus particles are 
spherical with an external diameter of about 300 A. The coat
